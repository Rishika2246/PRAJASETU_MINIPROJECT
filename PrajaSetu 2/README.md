# CIVIC

This is a code bundle for CIVIC. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/OWKB807TQtJVQgfg4EPUm4/CIVIC.

## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Security helpers

There's a `sec/` folder with helper scripts to generate demo keypairs for local testing (`sec/generate_keys_node.js`).
Do NOT commit any private keys. Keep `sec/private.pem` out of source control and follow best practices for production key management (KMS/HSM).
